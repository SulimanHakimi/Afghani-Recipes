    <h3>INSTRUCTIONS</h3>

    <p>
        1. Take your food processed onions, garlic, and fresh herbs and mixed into the ground meat.
        <br>
        2. Add each of the dry spices and mix thoroughly.
        <br>
        3. Patty each of the hamburger kabobs in a mostly flat shape so that you get the most crispy edges as possible.
        <br>
        4. Take a skillet and fill with enough oil to pan fry the kabob. Fry until the outsides are dark, crispy, and golden brown. That’s when you’ll know the chapli kebab is ready.</p>
